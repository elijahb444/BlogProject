# BlogProject

## Description

This project took me unreasonably longer than it should've, but it is what it is. 
This is a blog website. It takes in user input for their name, a title, and a text box for whatever content they want their post to have. The point of the website was to demonstrate the ability to use Web APIs intrinsic to JavaScript, such as Local Storage, Event Listeners, and using .createElement() and appendChild() to change a website using javascript, rather than doing so in the html file. 
The UI is a proper eyesore, but the focus is more on functionality than it is visual appeal. So please, keep an open mind. Be nice. I know its ugly.
